## Summary

As a programmer it was a right of a passage for me to create my own To-Do applicaiton. This project challenged me on the concepts of using the DOMs and gave me an introduction about event listeners. Reflecting back on this project, I will say creating this application elevated my skills to the next level as a programmer.
